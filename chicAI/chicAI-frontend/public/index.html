Say goodbye to the frustrating 'having a lot of clothes but no outfits' moments, and let ChicAI handle the hard work of styling you. It's more than just an app, It's a personal stylist in your pocket!"

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
